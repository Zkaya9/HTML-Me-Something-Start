            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p id="about" class="funParagraph">My name is Zeynep, I currently live in St. Louis, MO and work as an Enrollment Specialist for a Charter School District. 
            <br>While I’ve been interested in technology since kindergarten, my real programming journey started in 2016 when I joined
            <br> my schools robotics team worked on building, coding, and programming robots to do various functions.
            <br> I'm also studying computer science at the University of  Illinois - Springfield alongside taking <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/"> LaunchCode's Web Development Bootcamp</a></p>

            <h4>Projects:</h4>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/Zkaya9/Mars-Rover-Starter">Mars Rover Project</a> - This project simulates commanding the Mars rover Curiosity by implementing three classes: Command, Message, and Rover. The Command class defines instructions for the rover, the Message class bundles commands for delivery, and the Rover class handles received commands to update its properties. The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, where unit tests are written before coding each feature.</li>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/Zkaya9/Scrabble-Scorer-Autograded">Scrabble Scorer Project</a> - This project enhances a Scrabble scoring program by adding multiple scoring algorithms and allowing users to choose which one to use interactively. It includes functions for prompting the user to input a word, calculating the score using different scoring algorithms, and transforming the scoring system. The project is organized into tasks, starting with writing an initial prompt function and ending with submitting the completed work.</li>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/Zkaya9/Candidate-Testing-Autograded">Candidate Testing Project</a> - A console application for conducting short quizzes with candidates. The project prompts users to input their names, answers five questions, and calculates their overall score. Passing requires scoring >= 80%. The project is divided into three parts: creating the quiz, expanding it, and grading the results.</li>
